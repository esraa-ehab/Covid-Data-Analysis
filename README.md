# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about the spread and impact of the virus globally and regionally. The analysis includes data preprocessing, and visualization to understand various aspects of the pandemic.

## Data
### Sources
The primary dataset used in this project is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv). The dataset includes daily reports of COVID-19 cases, and deaths, vaccinations across different countries and regions.

### Preprocessing
The data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and to format it for analysis. Key preprocessing steps included:
- Filling missing values with appropriate strategies.
- Converting date columns to datetime format.
- Aggregating data at the country and state levels.

## Methods
### Tools
- **SQL**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization.

### Analysis Techniques
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data distribution, trends, and patterns.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing the trends over time.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping the spread of the virus geographically.

## Key Findings
- **Trend Analysis**: Identified peaks and troughs in the number of cases and deaths over time.
- **Geographic Spread**: Visualized the spread of the virus across different regions and identified hotspots.
- **Impact of Interventions**: Analyzed the impact of government interventions and policies on the spread of the virus.

## Visulaization
- The interactive dashboard provides a dynamic way to explore the COVID-19 data. Users can filter the data by date, region, and other parameters to visualize trends and patterns.
